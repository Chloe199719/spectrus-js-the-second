# Spectrus-js
## A hopefully less jank spectrogram

## Intended Features
1. properly designed
2. show fft and spectrogram views on separate canvases
3. formant tracking (maybe)
4. have ui with
  - pitch tracking
  - pitch floor alert
  - buttons for toggling views and tracking
  - scale
  - pause button
5. be less laggy than the original

## Running
This is an html + js program. You can either load it at [specv2.sumianvoice.com](https://specv2.sumianvoice.com/) or download the source files and drag the index.html file into any browser that allows javascript. It is self-contained and should run without needing a network connection.

## On mobile
Mobile is not supported but most devices will run it. Keep in mind this program is fairly CPU intensive.
